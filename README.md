# Circle Breakout
* A fun 2D game I developed using Unity Engine and C#, focusing on player control, collisions, game physics and score count.
* Created input control to rotate the player platform clockwise and anticlockwise with left and right arrow keys respectively.
* Implemented the Reflect function on collision to make the ball bounce back at the correct angle.
* Programmed the respawning of top and bottom set of obstacles after all of them are hit.
